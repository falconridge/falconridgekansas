  **Pool Updates**
  <br>
  Please review the included pool rules with your family so that we can have a safe and enjoyable pool season. The pools are serviced early morning and water chemistry is checked again in the afternoon. If there is a problem at the pool, or with the restroom facilities, please call The Tiehen Group at (913) 648-1188. If a problem occurs on a weekend or during evening hours, please listen to the voice prompts for reporting after hours emergencies and your call will be returned promptly.
  <br>
  <br>
  **Pool Monitoring**
  <br>
  It is unfortunate, but due to problems that have occurred in previous years, cameras have been installed to monitor activity at the pools. Entering the pool area after hours and/or inappropriate activity at the pool by any member of a family or a guest of a member will result in suspension of family pool privileges. In addition, any vandalism/damage to Association property will be reported to the police and parties involved will be prosecuted. Damage to our community results in increased expense in operations. We appreciate your help in making the pool season a good one!
